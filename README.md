### Description:
In this project I will work on the following case study:

*Your neighbor is a real estate agent and wants some help predicting housing prices for regions in the USA. It would be great if you could somehow create a model for her that allows her to put in a few features of a house and returns back an estimate of what the house would sell for. She has asked you if you could help her out with your new data science skills. You say yes, and decide that Linear Regression might be a good path to solve this problem! Your neighbor then gives you some information about a bunch of houses in regions of the United States,it is all in a cvs format.*

### Data:
